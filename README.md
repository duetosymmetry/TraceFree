TraceFree
=======

TraceFree is a simple xTension package for xAct.
It is forked from [HelloWorldxTension](https://github.com/xAct-contrib/HelloWorldxTension) as an example
of what needs to be changed to create a new package.
This package serves as an example for the framework
needed to create a package, and how to use xTension
to extend the capabilities of xAct.

Installation
------------
This directory should reside inside your xAct installation,
at the same level as xCore, xTensor, etc.
The directory tree should look like this:
```
xAct
|-- ...
|-- TraceFree
|   |-- Kernel
|   |   +-- init.m
|   |-- TraceFree.m
|   |-- TraceFree.nb
|   +-- README.md  (this file)
|-- xTensor
|-- ... (other xAct packages)
```
